Collections are managers for models, each collection represents a database table. Collections follow repository pattern, which is also called [data mapper pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mapper_pattern). 

This means collections are used to define custom query methods, start queries, and consequently perform save, remove, and load operation. Models on the other hand serve mostly as property definitions, and some methods isolated to work with those properties.

## Creating Collection

Before you can create a collection, you need to [define a Model first](/models/).

To simply create a collection, you can use `db.collection` method:

```ts [User.ts]
import { db, Collection } from '@deveox/nexus'

export const Users = db.collection(User, {
    ... // collection options
})

Users instanceof Collection // true
```

If you want to define custom methods for your collection you can use  `register` method like this:
```ts [User.ts]
import { register, db } from '@deveox/nexus'

class Collection extends register(User, {
    ... // collection options
}) {
    async findByEmail(email: string) {
        return this.select().where({ email }).one()
    }
}

export const Users = db.collection(Collection)
```

## Hooks
Hooks are functions that are called before or after certain operations, another common name for hooks is middleware.

All hooks are executed in a [transaction](/transactions), so you can safely use them to perform database operations.

Hooks are a good place to perform cascade operations, empowering relations between models with additional business logic.

::tip
For simplicity and convenience, `model` parameter in all hooks can be directly mutated. You don't need to return anything.
::

### beforeCreate
```ts
export const Users = db.collection(User, {
    async beforeCreate(tx: Transaction, model: Omit<User, 'id'>) {
        // do something before creating a model
        // for example, you can change model properties or do extra validation
    }
})

```

### afterCreate
```ts
export const Users = db.collection(User, {
    async afterCreate(tx: Transaction, model: User) {
        // do something after creating a model
        // for example, you can send an email to the user
    }
})
```

### beforeUpdate
```ts
::tip
Nexus always fetches model from database/cache before performing update. That's why you have access to the entire model, not just changes.

You can use `Model.prototype.$changes` to inspect changes done to the model.
::
export const Users = db.collection(User, {
    async beforeUpdate(tx: Transaction, model: User) {
        // do something before updating a model
        // for example, you can change model properties or do extra validation
    }
})
```
### afterUpdate

```ts
export const Users = db.collection(User, {
    async afterUpdate(tx: Transaction, model: User) {
        // do something after updating a model
        // for example, you can send an email to the user
    }
})
```

### beforeDelete
::tip
Nexus always fetches model from database/cache before performing delete. That's why you have access to the entire model in this hook.

If model is not found in database/cache, it will result in an error, and hook will not be called.
::

```ts
export const Users = db.collection(User, {
    async beforeDelete(tx: Transaction, model: User) {
        // do something before deleting a model
        // for example you can delete all related models
    }
})
```
### afterDelete

```ts
export const Users = db.collection(User, {
    async afterDelete(tx: Transaction, model: User) {
        // do something after deleting a model
        // for example you can send an email to the user
    }
}
```

## Events
Events extend original concept of hooks, you can register and dispatch custom events or use standard events which map 1-to-1 to hooks.

Standard events are:
- `beforeCreate`
- `afterCreate`
- `beforeUpdate`
- `afterUpdate`
- `beforeDelete`
- `afterDelete`

These standard events gives you ability to isolate cascade logic into dependencies and keep your code clean, for example:
```ts [Post.ts]
// Post belongs to User

import { Users } from './User'

export const Posts = db.collection(Post)
Users.on('beforeDelete', async (tx, user) => {
    await Posts.delete().where({ userId: user.id }).many(tx)
})
```
In example above, we are deleting all posts of a user when user is deleted. You can did it using `Users.beforeDelete` hook in `User.ts` file, but it can make your `User.ts` file very large and hard to maintain if you have a lot of relations. By moving this responsibility to `Post.ts` file, we get better SRP compliance and avoid circular imports.

### Custom Events
You can register custom events:
```ts
import { Event } from '@deveox/nexus'
export const Users = db.collection(User, {
    events: {
        // type parameter is optional, it's used to define payload type
        'read': Event<{ url: string }>()
    }
})
// Dispatch event
Users.dispatch('read', { url: 'https://example.com' })
// Subscribe to event
Users.on('read', (payload) => {
    console.log(payload.url) // string
})
```

### Global Subscriptions
You can subscribe to events globally, so you don't have to subscribe to each collection.
```ts
import { store } from '@deveox/nexus'

// subscribe on afterCreate event of all collections
store.on('*', 'afterCreate', (tx, model: Model) => { ... })

// subscribe on afterCreate event of Users and Post collection
store.on(['Users', 'Posts'], 'afterCreate', (tx, model: Model) => { ... })
