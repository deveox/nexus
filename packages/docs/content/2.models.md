Models are hydrated objects that represent your database records with additional methods and computed properties.

Each model you define is a class that extends `Model` class. The actual structure of underlying database record is defined by model schema. 

## Quick Start

Before you start, you need to define your [model schema](/schema).

```ts [User.ts]
import { n, model, db, Model } from '@deveox/nexus'

export class User extends model(schema) {
    get fullName() { // computed property
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
    }

    greet() { // custom method
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.fullName} and I'm ${this.age} years old`)
    }
}
```

Since most operations with models are managed by [Collections](/collections), let's create a simple collection:
```ts [User.ts]
import { db } from '@deveox/nexus'

... 

export const Users = db.collection(User)

const user = await Users.select().where({ email: 'john@example.com' }).one()
user instanceof Model // true
user instanceof User // true
```

## Custom Methods
It's very easy to add custom methods to your models. Just add a method to your class as you'd normally do:
```ts
class User extends model(schema) {
    async sendEmail() {
        console.log('Sending email to', this.$.email);
        // ...
    }
}
``` 


Methods exist only in runtime and never serialized to JSON or database.


## Computed Properties
You can define computed properties using native JavaScript syntax (class getters):
```ts
class User extends model(schema) {
    get fullName() {
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
    }
}
```
::tip
Computed properties are never serialized to database/json. While it maybe tempting to send your computed properties in JSON, it's not a good idea.
Computed properties are dynamic by definition, meaning that they reflect changes done to their source properties, if you serialize them, you lose this ability and potentially introduce inconsistencies.

## Update vs Save
Nexus supports partial updates, a.k.a `PATCH` requests, when you can update model by providing subset of its properties:

```ts
const user = await Users.
    update().
    where({ id: ... }).
    one({
        name: 'John Doe' // partial update
    })
```

This works well with JSON patch requests, but when you do some changes manually in your backend, it might be more convenient to edit model in-place:


```ts
user.name = 'John Doe'; // change name
await user.$save(); // save model, only `name` will be updated
```

Under the hood, model is wrapped in a lazy-evaluated `Proxy`, which keeps track of all changes done in-place. It works with nested objects and arrays as well!

Optionally, you can also reset changes (restore old values), by using `Model.prototype.$reset`:
```ts
user.name = 'John';
await user.$save();
user.name = 'Aaron';
user.$reset(); // reset changes
user.name // 'John'
```

## Changes
In update context (e.g. `beforeUpdate`, `afterUpdate` hooks) or after editing model manually, you can inspect changes using `Model.prototype.$changes` property. It returns special `ChangeTracker` class, which has various utility methods like `get` and `has`:

```ts
interface Change<V> {
    oldValue: V;
    newValue: V;
}

const change: Change<typeof user.status.name> = user.$changes.get('status.name')
if (change) {
    console.log(change.oldValue, change.newValue); 
}
```

If you don't care about values, you can use `has` method:
```ts
if (user.changes.has('status.name')) {
    console.log('Status name has changed');
}
```

This is especially useful in hooks, when you need to start some action only if property has changed.
