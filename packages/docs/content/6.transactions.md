Transactions are a fundamental concept in database management systems that ensure data integrity and consistency when performing multiple operations. A transaction is a sequence of one or more database operations that are treated as a single logical unit of work, which either completely succeeds or completely fails.

Nexus ORM supports transactions out of the box. You can use them in 2 ways, either using *Callback API or Flow API*.

Every [query](/query) in Nexus can be executed in transaction by passing `tx` argument to its finisher.

## When to Use Transactions

Transactions are essential in scenarios where:

- Multiple related operations need to succeed or fail together
- Data consistency must be maintained across multiple collections or tables
- Concurrent access to data needs to be coordinated
- Recovery from errors requires reverting partial changes

## Callback API

Suitable for simple cases when you don't need to handle commit/rollback/error handling manually.

```ts
import { db } from '@deveox/nexus'

db.withTransaction(async (tx) => {
    const user = await Users.create().one({ name: 'John Doe' }, tx)
    await Posts.create().one({ title: 'Hello World', userId: user.id }, tx)
})
```

### Flow API

Suitable for more complex cases. Gives you full control over transaction.

```ts
import { db } from '@deveox/nexus'

const tx = db.transaction() // start transaction

try {
    const user = await Users.create().one({ name: 'John Doe' }, tx)
    await Posts.create().one({ title: 'Hello World', userId: user.id }, tx)
    await tx.commit()
} catch (e) {
    // handle error
    await tx.rollback()
} 
```
